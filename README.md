# 🏥 Heart Disease Prediction  

This project predicts the severity of heart disease (0,1,2,3) using Machine Learning. It is trained on a real dataset with features like age, cholesterol, and ECG results.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔍 Predicts heart disease severity (0 = No Disease, 3 = Severe)  
- 📊 Uses *RandomForestClassifier* for classification  
- 🏷 Encodes categorical features with *Label Encoding*  
- 📈 Achieves ~59% accuracy (can be improved)  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains patient medical data, including:  
- *Numerical features*: Age, trestbps (blood pressure), chol (cholesterol), oldpeak  
- *Categorical features*: Chest pain type, ECG results, thal (heart defect type)  
- *Target variable*: num (0, 1, 2, 3 → severity of heart disease)
